# Personal-finance-tracker
A responsive web application for tracking personal expenses, managing budgets, and visualizing spending patterns. Built with vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core web development fundamentals.

## Change log (session summary)
- Removed duplicate JSON export function and redundant on-load CSV export to avoid unintended auto-downloads.
- Consolidated event wiring to prevent double-triggered add/budget actions.
- Left core UI/logic intact while keeping exports, filters, budgets, and charts functioning as before.
